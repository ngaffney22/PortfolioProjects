# Nicholas Gaffney - Data Analysis Portfolio 
## About
Hello, my name is Nick! I have a technical background focused on analysis with big data and I have my most 
recent bachelor's degree in Information Science. I also have the AWS cloud practitioners certification . I have spent the 
last few years interpreting and analyzing data utilizing various programming techniques I have learned during my 
studies at The University of Maryland. During my time there, I have learned about managing the data lifecycle, how to use various programming tools 
like Python, SQL, R, Anaconda, Excel, and many others. I have a great passion for digging into statistical 
significance, data-driven optimization, data manipulation, reporting on findings, and overall digesting 
data into manageable categories for end user utilization.

## Portfolio Projects
This section will describe all of my projects that are stored in this repository
### Covid Data Exploration
**Code:** [CovidProject.sql](https://github.com/ngaffney22/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidProject.sql) <br>
**Tableau Dashboard:** [My BI Visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicholas.gaffney/viz/CovidDashboard_16422811510540/Dashboard1)<br>
**Description:** For this project I chose to analyze current data that is activly being updated and changed. The data for this project comes from a site called "Our World in Data." This site collected the data for this project from various government organizations all over the world. (such as CDC and WHO in the US) I pushed this data into a relational database in Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio. From there I Wrangled the data creating views that could be used for later research. 
After getting the data set up the way that I wanted for the analysis. I pushed the tables I created using SQl into seperate Excel files and then into 4 seperate pages in Tableau. I created 4 seperate visualizations to illistrate the findings in the data and allow for better analysis. <br>
**Skills:** data wrangling, data cleaning, time series analysis, data visualization, database managment, statistical analysis. <br>
**Technology:** SQL, Tableau, Microsoft SSMS <br>
**Results:** The main outcome that came from this project was a better understanding of the death rates in various parts of the world. One thing that I noticed was the discrepencies in covid deaths in the data and the number of cases. Something that I could test in future analysis would be *why* the data from certain contries are short on data when compaired to others. I believe this has to do with countries with much larger built in infrastructure to allow them to produce detailed data needed for covid case evaluation. This is because a country like the US has much larger infrastructure for proper testing centers and such as compaired to much smaller less developed countries.     
### Movie Data Correlation
**Code:** [MovieData-Correlation.ipynb](https://github.com/ngaffney22/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/MovieData-Correlation%20.ipynb) <br>
**Description:** For this project I wanted to take data I found on a Kaggle dataset and run some correlation on it. I cleaned and organized this movie dataset in preperation for analysis. From there I created various visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn in order to analyze the data looking for correlations between variables.
My first hypothesis for this data was that there would be a high correlation between the 'budget' of the film and the 'gross' money from the film. The second hypothesis is that there would be a high correlation between the 'company' producing the film and the 'gross' money earned from the film. <br>
**Skills:** data wrangling, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, hypothesis testing, statistical analysis, regression modeling. <br>
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib. <br>
**Results:**  The larger of the two heatmaps I produced showed a stong correlation of .74 between the budget of the film and the gross money earned from the film. This supports my first hypothesis which stated there would be a high corrleation between these two variables. However, this same heatmap also countered the second hypothesis as it shows a very weak correlation between company and the gross money earned from the films. A linear regression model could also work for this and I may do that in the future.
